  goodEvents:
  - The most recent round of jettisoning went so well, the crew are all feeling better
    despite their current situation.
  badEvent:
  - Without a working airlock, the crew have taken to improvising spacewalks for
    repairs using a bungee cord, a vacuum cleaner, and cunning use of the buddy system
