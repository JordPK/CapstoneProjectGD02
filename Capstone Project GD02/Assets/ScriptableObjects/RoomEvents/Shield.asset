  goodEvents:
  - 'Someone got lost in the shield generator and was able to turn it on immediately
    under attack '
  badEvent:
  - Your crew open the ship up for "shieldless ship tours" claiming how you are entirely
    lacking defensive capabilities....... this intimidated the enemies into giving
    you resources.
  - The best defence is a  good offence
  - A group of crew mates were found huddling under blankets and umbrellas to make
    up for the loss of the shields
  - The crew undertake additional superstitious practices
  - "That\u2019s no moon... it\u2019s a rogue asteroid heading straight for our hull!"
